<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Taurus, the Earthy Zodiac Sign that’s Sensible AND Sensual</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Sensual Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty.
Your sign loves great food, romance and beautiful things. Venus kicks your five senses into high gear, so you are are happiest when surrounded by the best of everything. Satin sheets, gourmet dinners, a glass of red wine, and boom… you’re relaxing into one of your famous, 14-hour naps. Not that you don’t work hard, too.
<br>
<br>
Like a bull, Taurus operates at two speeds: either totally relaxed, or charging headfirst towards a target. You prefer to keep the peace, but when you’re pushed past your limit, watch out! Underneath it all, you just want to be comfortable, and surrounded by life’s finest offerings.
<br>
<br>
Taurus knows what s/he likes, and that’s that. You stick with your opinions, and you don’t change unless there’s a really good reason. You can be stubborn… but on the upside, you’re also loyal and dependable.
<br>
<br>
Just be careful not to get stuck in a safety zone or your life could become stagnant. Take a chance and try something new. Sometimes, change and risk can bring the progress and reward you’re wishing for.

<p class="p1" align="left">
December 29, 2020: <br> Close friendships feel extra meaningful under the glow of today’s full moon in Cancer and your social third house. As la luna spotlights special connections, show your appreciation for people who had your back when you really needed it this year. Neighbors, co-workers and the people you interacted with on Zoom could be the heroes of your 2020. Find a way to thank them, perhaps by having one of their favorite takeout meals delivered. The third house also rules local activity, so if you’re shopping for post-holiday sale items, patronize nearby mom-and-pop shops.

From December 28 to January 3: <br>
If you're still prepping for the New Year, pair up FTW this Tuesday, December 29, when 2020’s second full moon in Cancer bursts into your cooperative third house. While you like everything "just so," there's no reason you can't delegate aspects of your vision, especially to peers such as siblings, cousins and close friends. Let your tech-savvy sister get the luddites set up for your streaming dance party and your roommate manage the doorside delivery of champagne.
<br>
<br>
Who knows? Their creative additions might actually strengthen your existing vision. Because the third house is your communication sector, this full moon might instigate some lively interchanges, including some flirty exchanges on the apps. But if you’re getting “needy emotional sponge” vibes, mute that thread. Since the third house is also your transportation sector, this full moon may inspire you to update your ride. Taurus writers and media makers could have a burst of inspiration—a cathartic way to wrap up this year!
<br>
<br>
A low-key NYE might be your preference this year, whether you're relaxing in a beach hammock or hosting an intimate dinner party on Zoom. The Leo moon is nestled in your sentimental fourth house on both NYE and NYD, so you actually won’t mind being “forced” to stay at home. This is one of those years where you’d rather wax nostalgic with family than make lame small talk with people you'll probably never see again. When you wake up to 2021 this Friday, your first resolutions may revolve around domestic matters. What does an ideal home look like to you in the year ahead? Ready, set, vision board!
