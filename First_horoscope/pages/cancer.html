<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Cancer, the Zodiac Sign of the Caring Crab Who Feels Everything Deeply</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Sensitive Cancer is ruled by the ever-changing Moon, and your moods go through many cycles.
You’re intuitive and nurturing, even psychic. Pay attention to your dreams, especially near a Full Moon.
<br>
<br>
You are sensitive and loyal, with a ready shoulder to cry on. Cancer loves to get domestic, serving your friends and family home-baked goodies and tea. When you get moody, you need to be comforted, or else just left alone.
<br>
<br>
Like a crab, you can cling — or pinch — when you feel threatened or vulnerable. And thrifty Cancers can pinch pennies just as tightly. (Of course, you also love to spend! It’s a mood thing.)
<br>
<br>
To make life easier, surround yourself with comfort: a cozy sweater, a favorite book, trusted friends, and a stash of your favorite goodies. Cancers are close to their moms, so keep yours on speed-dial and call her when you’re down.

December 29, 2020: <br> What a lunar year it’s been for you, Cancer! Today, 2020’s second full moon in your sign activates your trailblazing, self-expressive first house. Look back: Did you manifest something important near the first full moon on January 10, which was also a lunar eclipse? And what passions were percolating during the summer’s double-header of new moons in Cancer: the solstice solar eclipse on June 21 and the July 20 new moon? Plans you’ve had in motion all year could come to a glittering finale or be blessed with another strong tailwind as you sail into 2021. Focus on you today and dream without restraint!

From December 28 to January 3: <br>
Tuesday, December 29, is like an early New Year for you as the full moon beams into your sign for the second time in 2020. (The first one was actually a lunar eclipse on January 10!) Under this head-turning lunation, you'll shine like the tree in Trafalgar Square. So while you might not be going further than your own living room, you might get inspired to livestream yourself in action. (Now starring Cancer as a TikTok cottagecore influencer?) 
<br>
<br>
You’re not always comfortable with all eyes on you. Nevertheless, don't run from this well-deserved attention. You've earned it, Cancer, so why deny people the chance to sing your praises? If you've been conforming to standards that just aren't authentic, switch up your strategy—to thine own self be true! Even if that means diverging from the pack on certain issues, follow YOUR guidance and believe that all the answers you need live inside of you. Sure, you may have to meditate or journal or even talk to a neutral sounding board to distill your own truth. But a powerful message lies in your psyche. Carve out time this week to sit in quiet solitude and download the wisdom of your own inner voice. You may rise from your meditation cushion with a white light realization that it's time for a major change—OR that you're more grateful than you realized for the life that you're living.
<br>
<br>
If you're searching for your truth this Wednesday, don't get lost in analysis paralysis. As Venus squares nebulous Neptune, every hypothesis you try on will only send you tumbling deeper down the rabbit hole. Harder still? You're bound to have an emotional reaction to each of those "what if" scenarios. What's the point of getting all worked up over potentially…nothing? Spare yourself the upsets and stop postulating. The only way to find out what's really going on is to investigate firsthand. Conversations are required, but make sure you set these heart-to-hearts for times when everyone is as relaxed as they can possibly be.
<br>
<br>
Thursday is New Year's Eve, and you are counting down to an elegant (and 100 percent Cancer-approved) finish to 2020. Nope, you can't be the wild child swinging from the chandeliers this year, but that doesn't mean you won't be having the time of your life. With the Moon in Leo luxuriating in your decadent second house, you'd be happy to dress up in your NYE finest and hosting a luxe celebration with whoever is in your pandemic pod. What better excuse for a fancy meal than bidding adieu to a challenging year and ringing in the new one with your wise, evolved perspective? Whether you spend all day (or half the week) preparing a meal or support a local restaurant by picking up that haute fare is up to you! Opt for whatever you find most relaxing.
