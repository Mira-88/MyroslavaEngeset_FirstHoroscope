<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Aquarius, the Free-Spirited Zodiac Sign that Prizes Individuality but Plays Well on a Team</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Avant-garde Aquarius is ruled by Uranus, the only planet in the solar system that spins on its side!
Just like your celestial overlord, you’ve been known to do things your own way, moving on a path different from everyone else’s. Some call you eccentric, others appreciate your cutting-edge originality and authentic style.
<br>
<br>
One of the many ways that Aquarius is a paradox? You’re highly individualistic, but also an amazing team player. Aquarius rules the zodiac’s eleventh house of teamwork, technology and friendship. You might look like the fresh-faced guy or girl next door on the outside, but inside you march to your own beat.
<br>
<br>
Many Aquarians are also naturally popular, as your vibrantly social sign loves to be among your people, telling jokes and introducing thought-provoking conversation topics. People truly do make your world go round, and you can become insta-BFFs with the most random strangers. As the sign of the future, you can be a bit of an alien—a little “out there” in your approach. Not that you care about offending anyone!
<br>
<br>
Aquarius rules casual connections, and you can disengage as quickly as you connect. In fact, your platonic pals may get better treatment than your romantic partners. While you can be a bit unsentimental on a one-on-one level, you can be moved to tears by the plight of animals, the environment or other social justice issues. Yes, you’re a bohemian at heart in some ways, but you also get the job done.
<br>
<br>
As a tenacious fixed sign, you can be quite hardworking when you devote yourself to a goal. A competitive (and lesser-known) Type A streak can emerge when you really want something. Nothing turns you on like progress, especially in the name of your grander ideals!

December 29, 2020: <br> Since cookies, eggnog and other holiday goodies are ubiquitous this time of year—not to mention irresistible—minimize some of the impact by intentionally “greening up” your diet this week. You’ll get some help today as 2020’s second full moon in Cancer lights up your sixth house of healthy living and service. Since deprivation will only backfire, be selective with your indulgences, only saying yes to your absolute favorites and savoring every bite. Squeezing in some additional exercise could help you feel less “guilty.” While you’re on this (hot buttered) roll, see what home fitness equipment has gone on sale since Christmas!

<h3 align="left" style="color:darkblue">Aquarius Weekly Horoscope</h3>

<p class="p1" align="left">
From December 28 to January 3: <br>
You could catch a somewhat inconveniently timed wellness buzz this Tuesday, December 29, as 2020's second full moon in Cancer goes harvesting in your healthy, efficient sixth house. If self-care is the one thing you've let slide in this crazy year, you don't have to wait until January 2 to bring it back. If nothing else, commit to a healthier diet—even in the face of holiday treats—and restock your fridge and cupboards with nourishing fare. 
<br>
<br>
Over the two weeks ruled by this salubrious moon, research easy, warm-your-bones recipes that call for fresh ingredients instead of processed ones. And once the holiday treats are polished off, consider doing a mini detox or cleanse. Schedule some bodywork to get out the kinks and load up on vitamin C and other immunity-supporting supplements to keep winter colds at bay.
<br>
<br>
The efficiency-boosting moonbeams will do more to help you lifehack your way into 2021. As you review the top three items on your "start the New Year strong" list, think about how you can add an extra, polished touch. Don't forget the importance of marketing yourself. In the most charming way possible, make sure the office influencers and decision makers—or your most important clients—are aware of your contributions and efforts before the ball drops on 2021!
<br>
<br>
Set the table for two this NYE. As the moon hovers in Leo and your partnership house you'll want to ring in 2021 with your favorite person. Be it your bae or your BFF, these verbose moonbeams will get you gushing. Raise a toast in their honor. Coupled Water Bearers might bring that attitude of gratitude to your, ahem, private celebration. There are ways to say "thank you" that don't require words. Single? Nothing wrong with joining a virtual gathering. A fascinating conversation could lure you into a breakout room to mingle with more intimate intent. The moon will be hovering in Leo on New Year's Day, too, but since 2021 launches with Jupiter and Saturn in your independent first house, you might be more interested in your OWN passions than the kind you share with a plus-one. Let your mind go wild: What sorts of adventures COULD you pull off in the year ahead? And while they may involve a running mate, some may be purely driven by your own desires. Nothing wrong with that, Aquarius!
