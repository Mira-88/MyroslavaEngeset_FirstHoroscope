<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Scorpio, the Intense and Mysterious Zodiac Sign that Has Quite a Reputation</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Intense Scorpio is ruled by Pluto, planet of power and control. Pluto is a tiny powerhouse, and a bit of a mystery; in mythology Pluto was the god of the underworld.

Many Scorpios are also drawn to “dark” things, and often wear the color black, or a shocking tone like red or hot pink. Like Pluto, Scorpio’s power often emanates from a hidden source, even when you don’t say a word. Mysterious Scorpio is the zodiac’s most misunderstood sign.
<br>
<br>
You’re so powerful that people feel your presence, even before you’ve said a word! Sensitive Scorpio picks up vibes. You see every little detail, and you can read people like an open book. Once your friends get used to your high-intensity style, they know that you’re fiercely loyal. Anyone who betrays you had better watch out! Like a Scorpion, you’ll deliver a painful sting of revenge.
<br>
<br>
Since your sign is naturally secretive, work on being more open with people. This will develop trust, and improve your relationships.
<br>
<br>
Scorpio’s concentration powers are amazing, but be careful not to get obsessed. Curb any jealous or possessive feelings by pouring your energy into a creative project or passion.

December 29, 2020: <br> Big dreams that have been hovering on the horizon could come into sharp focus today as 2020’s second full moon in Cancer activates your “no limits” ninth house. If you don’t have locked-and-loaded New Year’s plans (or if you do but aren’t exactly thrilled about them), start scheming. Visiting a friend who’s been safely hanging solo or finding a beachy vacation rental within driving distance could help you wrap this long, rough year on a brighter note. If that’s not an option, let this “caution-to-the-wind” energy inspire you to plan something close to home, like an intention-setting fire ceremony with your BFFs.

From December 28 to January 3: <br>
On Tuesday, the Cancer full moon illuminates your ninth house of travel, adventure and cross-cultural connections. The energy is electric and spontaneous, so be ready for anything, including a last-minute switcheroo to your New Year's plans. While Cancer is the domestic sign, this full moon could point you to a "home away from home," such as a friend's vacation rental that just happened to open up for the week—or to visit a relative who has been quarantining safely enough for an IRL hang. Even if you're not hitting the road, you can have some titillating escapades closer to home. A short getaway, even just a one-day road trip, will do wonders to revive your sense of wonder.
<br>
<br>
If you're traveling in the virtual sense, you can liven things up by chatting with people from different backgrounds—taking a stab at foreign languages as the situation requires. (Hello, Google Translator app!) This expansive full moon makes you feel like the local ambassador. It will help you build bridges with people in your community, and maybe join in a collective activist mission. It doesn't have to be complicated, Scorpio. Even an open-ended discussion in a Zoom room can spark meaningful change.
<br>
<br>
You’re going to have to seriously squint to tell the difference between fantasy and reality this Wednesday. Thanks to a quixotic—but alas, misleading—mashup between romantic Venus and Neptune, you’d rather ignore inconvenient truths. But these things will have a way of catching up to you, especially if they come with a high price tag, hidden clause or glycemic index. Read all the labels and the fine print before you Venmo a single cent. And when it comes to love, take nothing at face value. The charmers will be out in full force and even the savviest Scorpios will be putty in their hands. It’s fine to enjoy a little unrestrained hedonism…within limits. In the second half of the week, however, anything “bottomless” could bring you to “rock bottom” fast.
<br>
<br>
The moon is in Leo on both NYE and NYD, and since the lion presides over your prestigious tenth house, you may be wishing there was a fancy party you could attend. But sigh, COVID… Looks like you're going to have to figure out a different way to get your black-tie fix. One idea: Instead of hosting a Zoom dinner party, how about upleveling it to a charity gala? Charge a "ticket price" then give all proceeds to an area non-profit that could benefit from your donation. An earthy celebration might also get you back to your rooted self as this ungrounded year ends. If you feel comfortable traveling, rent a cabin in the woods or take a country drive on Thursday or Friday and hike amongst the trees. Wherever you find yourself, career goals could be top of mind. This inspired lunar energy may bring a creative burst at any moment, so if you get hit with a download, slip off to capture it. Heck, turn it into your first 2021 resolution. Your party pod will understand!
