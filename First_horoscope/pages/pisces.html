<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Pisces, the Empathic and Imaginative Zodiac Sign that Contains Multitudes</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Pisces is symbolized by two fish swimming in opposite directions. A part of you is always trying to “swim away” or escape reality. The other part is so intuitive that you get swept up in everything going on.
Your imagination is the perfect hideout when you want to escape, since Pisces is so creative. You love dancing (Pisces rules the feet), movies, poetry, and music.
<br>
<br>
Your moods are mysterious and your dreams are intense. Every Pisces should have a journal by your bed, since some your best ideas will come in your sleep.
<br>
<br>
Although you can feel helpless, you’re much stronger than you think. The best way for Pisces to experience your own strength is to help people in need. You have great compassion and incredible healing powers.
<br>
<br>
Because it’s easy for people to make you feel guilty, Pisces should watch out for friends who use you, or make you doubt yourself. Surround yourself with good-hearted friends who have their acts together.
<br>
<br>
Many people born under your sign have a “tortured soul” quality. Finding a tranquil spiritual outlet, or spending time alone, can help you get re-centered in your own power.</p>

From December 28 to January 3: <br>
The cosmic spotlight makes you its target this Tuesday, December 29, as the year's second full moon in Cancer rocks your fifth house of flamboyance, fame and amour. Got a message or project to get out there? Don't sit around hoping someone will "discover" you. This enterprising full moon gives you permission to self-promote. Blast the world with Instagrams, TikToks, Tweets and, if appropriate, good-old fashioned group texts.
<br>
<br>
Since you can be modest about self-promotion, focus on your services and offerings. What's in it for other people? When you think about it that way, it feels anything but narcissistic. Don't deprive the world of the gifts that are flowing through you. In the romance department, the full moon unleashes a milestone moment, whether that's achieving liftoff with a new relationship or allowing a moribund one to finally come to its inevitable finale. It's better to have your self-respect intact than be stuck with someone who makes you feel unappreciated or less than your best. In an LTR? Seize the reins and steer things in a playful, or full-on wild, direction. The gentlest nudge (and nuzzle) might be all your S.O. needs to get on board with your dreamy schemes for romance.
