<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Virgo, the Earthy and Elegant Zodiac Sign that Loves to Make a Plan</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Detail-oriented Virgo is ruled by Mercury, planet of the mind and communication.
Virgos are always analyzing everything, forming opinions and judgments. On the outside, you seem sweet and innocent, but your quick mind never misses a detail.
<br>
<br>
Virgo is also the sign of service, and you’re always there when help is needed. You’re an amazing, careful listener, and as a result, you give the best advice. You love to analyze everything! In fact, you can drive yourself crazy, because you never stop thinking. Virgo is a perfectionist who sees every flaw, and at times, you’re a little too critical.
<br>
<br>
Relax your mind by channeling it into a project, like solving a crossword puzzle, writing a story, or organizing your desk
<br>
<br>
As an earth sign, you love the outdoors, so chill out in nature, or try a sport like karate.
<br>
<br>
Remember, it’s easy for helpful Virgo to give, but harder for you to receive. Let your friends pitch in and support you, too! Try opening up a little more. You don’t have to be perfect to be loveable. Just be yourself.

December 29, 2020: <br> It’s not too late to tweak your New Year’s plans, Virgo—especially if you get a brainstorm today! With the year’s second full moon in nurturing Cancer and your innovative eleventh house, you might have a genius idea about how, or with whom, to celebrate, whether safely IRL or with a virtual soiree. And because the eleventh house rules the digital realm, this is the perfect day to explore technology to support this vision. No need to play instant IT whiz, though! Your favorite DJs may already live-streaming, or maybe there’s a Zoom meditation you can participate in—or both!
</p>

<h3 align="left" style="color:darkblue">Virgo Weekly Horoscope</h3>

<p class="p1" align="left">
From December 28 to January 3: <br>
Your discerning sign knows that you're judged by the company you keep. And this Tuesday, December 29, the second Cancer full moon of 2020 could reshuffle the hierarchy of your social circle. Under the influence of this community-spirited full moon, you can pool your resources with some truly innovative—and likeminded—souls, or at least get talks underway for a collective effort that you'll launch in early 2021. And with this lunar lift logging in to your eleventh house of collaboration and technology, you can broaden your reach by thinking digitally.
<br>
<br>
Are your devices in need of an update? Returning that stack of Christmas sweaters might generate the cash you need to get the make, model (and style!) of a device that suits your needs AND your super-specific Virgo preferences. The eleventh house also rules humanitarian efforts, and this full moon could point you toward an activist group or community effort you want to support in the new year.
<br>
<br>
Wednesday’s befuddling clash between Venus and Neptune will make it hard to tell fact from fiction. And it doesn’t help that your emotions will be clouding even the most “obvious” situation. Put off big decisions until the weekend—especially if they have to do with relatives and relationships. Speaking of which, those two groups of people may be like oil and water near Wednesday. Don’t try to play peacemaker if your mom starts making underhanded comments about your partner (or potential bae). You may not be able to find a suitable compromise at the moment—not while everyone’s playing passive aggressive games in order to get their way. Best bet for you? Stay out of the middle!
<br>
<br>
Don't even think about setting an alarm New Year's Day! If you promised to go for a sunrise stroll, the only reason to make good on that is if you stayed up all night. The moon lingers in Leo and that same dreamy twelfth house this Friday, January 1, and your first "resolution" of 2021 could literally come to you in your sleep. Ease into this calendar turning with a day of decadence and self-care. Lounge in your fanciest PJs, take calls from the tub, or just let everyone go through to voicemail until you're actually in the mood to talk!
