<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Aries, the Pioneering Zodiac Sign that Loves to Be First!</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Aries is ruled by Mars, the fiery red planet of energy and drive. In mythology, Mars was the god of war and aggression.Highly impatient and competitive, many Aries have the fighting spirit of your mythological ruler. You love to be a hero–or to be swept away by one.
<br>
<br>
As the zodiac’s first sign, you were born to be number one. You’re a solo star who steals the spotlight and inspires everyone with your confidence. Yeah, you can be impatient, even a little bossy, especially when you don’t get your way.
<br>
<br>
As the “baby” of the zodiac, you need lots of attention, and can throw quite the tantrum when you don’t get it. Fortunately, you rarely have a problem turning heads. Your friends love to follow as you lead them on the latest adventure. Make sure to let other people be the boss every now and then, too, or you could alienate potential allies. Focus your competitive streak into a diva-worthy goal, delegate to your troops, and you’ll rise to the top!

December 29, 2020: <br> In the afterglow of Christmas, keep on reveling in the simple joys of cozy evenings at Chateau Aries. With the final full moon of 2020 arriving in Cancer, the best bliss will be of the domestic variety. If all’s not peaceful under your roof, la luna could spotlight some home- or family-related issues that should be addressed before you ring in 2021. But note: People could be hypersensitive, so slip on the kid gloves before delving into anything too delicate. It’s also a perfect day for some much-needed self-care. Save the chores for another time (unless you’re actually into folding laundry) and relax with a cup of mulled cider and a new series.

From December 28 to January 3: <br>
If you're (not-so) secretly enjoying this year's "home for the holidays" mandate, we wouldn't be surprised. With a potent full moon in emo Cancer and your domestic sector on Tuesday, December 29, you're not in the mood for much more than a chill week in. Chez Ram should feel like your oasis, and if it doesn't, get ready­­—because your inner interior decorator may come to life. It's less about producing an Instagram-worthy set than making your space as peaceful and comfortable as possible. 
<br>
<br>
Take advantage of post-holiday sales to set up a cozy, efficient—and affordable—base camp. If, on the other hand, you've been mulling a move, developments could accelerate. But don't wait for a fabulous new space to fall into your lap. Scour listings and set up Zillow alerts so that you can go check out potential places the moment realtors are back at their desks. Over the next two weeks, you have the opportunity to improve relationships with roomies or family members and to dissolve tension. The best way isn't by dredging up old grudges and laments but by leading with love!
<br>
<br>
You may struggle to release something this Wednesday, as Venus and Neptune lock into a complicated square. On a logical level, you’re aware that a change is overdue. But feelings like guilt, grief or misplaced obligation are making it hard for you to speak up for what you want. Notice what’s going on inside of you but don’t react. This is a conversation between you and you, Aries, and you need to get clear about what is best for Numero Uno. While certain people won’t love the choice that emerges, consider the alternative. Subverting your needs—and feeling miserable all the time—so that other people are happy? That will never work for the self-directed Ram! This transit also warns against toying with temptation. Don’t put yourself in compromising situations or “experiment” with anything you haven’t fully researched. There’s much more to this than meets the eye, and alas, what’s hidden is probably not so pretty.
