<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Gemini, the Chatty and Clever Zodiac Sign of the Twins</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">The Gemini mind (and mouth!) is a busy machine, always moving at warp speed.
That’s because your sign is ruled by Mercury, the planet of communication. Mercury also rules technology and the mind, making Gemini one of the most curious and cutting-edge signs of the zodiac.
<br>
<br>
If two is double the fun, then as the sign of the twins, you know it’s true! There are at least two personalities inside of you at all times. Adventurous Geminis change faster than the weather, and constantly flip between moods and interests.
<br>
<br>
If possible, try to stick with a couple key passions for the long haul, and get really good at them. You love to chatter and you have a million great ideas. Keep your fast-moving mind and hands busy with email, instant messages, mobile gadgets, and great conversations. Watch a temptation to gossip. Keep a notebook handy to jot down your thoughts at all times.

<p class="p1" align="left">
December 29, 2020: <br> The second Cancer full moon of 2020 lights up your decadent second house, which may spark visions of alpaca comforters and a little post-holiday gift-shopping for yourself! If you have any cash left over, go ahead and treat yourself, Gemini. Just make sure it’s something you truly want or need—and bonus points if you get it on sale! La luna in this sensual zone dials up the feels and may inspire you to never step foot outside the house today—especially if your favorite plus-one is there.

<h3 align="left" style="color:darkblue">Gemini Weekly Horoscope</h3>

<p class="p1" align="left">
From December 28 to January 3: <br>
On Tuesday, December 29, 2020’s second full moon in Cancer lights up your grounded second house, bringing one last financial audit for the year. Are you feeling safe and secure? Is money flowing in or do you need to search for new income streams? With all the uncertainty of 2020, it’s been an economic roller coaster ride. In rooted Cancer, this lunar light might shine on areas that could use some bolstering.
<br>
<br>
Don’t forget, Gemini, that your next-door-neighbor sign is among the most family-friendly of them all. Caring people are all around you, but unless you clue them in, they might just assume that everything’s A-OK on your end.  Your second house is the tradition-loving sector of your chart, and because the full moon's influence lingers for two weeks, you might be the glue that holds your crew together this holiday season—even if you’re not able to be together in person. Get everyone involved in a new tradition, like virtual cookie-baking or caroling or making charity donations in each other's names. Twins on the hunt for steady employment may be filling out applications—or even getting hired—within the next two weeks.
<br>
<br>
Don't put the cart before the relationship horse this Wednesday when love planet Venus gets snared by nebulous Neptune. You've been getting a string of green lights lately, so naturally, you feel confident charging ahead with talks about all your #LoveGoals. But under this elusive transit, your enthusiasm could be misinterpreted as pressure. We're not going to give you a hard time about the shoe being on the other foot, Gemini. But the fact is, you're no fan of being rushed into commitment yourself. Even if you're just trying to get a videochat on the books (and not a marriage proposal!), you may be met with resistance. Keep your energy balanced and neutral. Don't pull away…just let people miss you!
