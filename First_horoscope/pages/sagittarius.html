<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Sagittarius, the Wild, Worldly and Adventurous Zodiac Sign that Lives to Make You Laugh</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Cheerful Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system. Jupiter is the “happy” planet, full of energy and confidence. Sagittarians often reflect Jupiter’s larger-than-life persona.
As the zodiac’s traveler, Sagittarius is the ultimate free spirit: optimistic, open-minded and ambitious. You’re happiest in wide-open spaces with plenty of adventure and excitement.
<br>
<br>
You juggle a million projects, hobbies and friends. The more, the merrier! Sagittarius is forever pursuing a super-sized goal. Even when you fail, nothing can keep you down. You’ll chalk it up as a life lesson and inspire everyone with tales of your experience.
<br>
<br>
As the sign of wisdom and truth, Sagittarius loves to “tell it like it is,” especially when it makes people laugh. However, your honesty doesn’t always come in the prettiest package. You’ve been known to bruise feelings with your bluntness. Cultivate patience, and be careful not to come off as a know-it-all.
<br>
<br>
Although Sag loves the thrill of a new project or friendship, you don’t always finish what you start. Work on keeping your promises and commitments.

December 29, 2020: <br> The full moon in Cancer is firing up your intimate, erotic eighth house today, so don’t be surprised if THAT person keeps popping into your head. If necessary, rearrange your schedule so you can spend quality time together, IRL or on a lingering video-chat. If no one has that effect on your EKG, make a point of looking harder (or being a smidge less fussy). The next two weeks are prime manifesting time for a soulmate-worthy partner. Couples might feel ready to take a significant next step now, but this full moon could also herald a “make it or break it” moment with a relationship that’s been on the rocks for a while. Whatever the case, you’ll be glad to move into the New Year with clarity.

From December 28 to January 3: <br>
You won't even miss the absent mistletoe this Tuesday, December 29—not with 2020's second full moon in Cancer beaming into your intense and erotic eighth house. If an undeniable connection's been building for the past several months—or even since the Cancer lunar (full moon) eclipse on January 10—it could culminate in a bodice-ripping adventure. Single and swiping? This soulful full moon may deliver the kind of deep mind-body-spirit connection you've been dreaming about. It's not hard for you to charm with your wisdom and your wit, but finding someone who can banter right back? That's rare. 
<br>
<br>
While you're wrapped up in a deep, philosophical conversation, the minutes could just melt away. Coupled Archers can bring sexy back by not trying too hard. The key lies in giving yourself more downtime to relax. But if the only movement you've gotten in the past month is along that well-worn track between the sofa and the fridge, it would be little wonder if your mojo is in slow-mo. Sweat it out on your yoga mat to get your chi flowing again. A few killer workouts may be all it takes to resuscitate the slumbering Sagittarius siren.
<br>
<br>
Everything’s coming up rose-colored this Wednesday when Venus and Neptune dance into a hypnotic square—so much so that you shouldn’t rely on “pure intuition” to make your decisions. Both of these planets are known for distorting reality so that you only see what you WANT to see instead of what’s actually there. With Venus in your sign, you’re laser-focused on the bright side of things. But Neptune’s fog machine effects will conceal a few details that are cause for concern. No need to panic, Archer, or even walk away. Just be prepared to dig deeper when you get excited about an “opportunity.” There’s probably a lot to be jazzed about here. You’ll just need to set clear boundaries when it comes to how much time or money you invest. Wednesday is NOT the day to simply surrender and go with the flow, no matter how tempting it may be!
<br>
<br>
As the flames purify your intentions, you will be free to make fresh resolutions on Friday, January 1, 2021, since the New Year begins with the same Leo moon hovering overhead! Themes of expansion and personal growth may be top of mind. How do you see yourself evolving in the New Year? This may not be about amassing "more," but rather elevating to a more prestigious or high-quality tier.
