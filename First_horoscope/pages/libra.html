<p class="p1" align="justify">Gentle Libra is ruled by Venus, planet of beauty and love. Perhaps that explains your smooth talk and pretty face.
Like Taurus, which is also Venus-ruled, Libras love to be surrounded by art, culture and beauty in a soft, harmonious environment. You love good food and expensive things.
<br>
<br>
Lovely Libra knows how to charm but behind your dimples and sweet personality, you’re a fighter. Libra is the sign of the scales, and you can’t stand anything that’s unfair or unbalanced. You love a designer outfit as much as you adore a good debate.
<br>
<br>
You’ll stand up for justice, and you’ll do it with style. Libra hates to be rushed–you prefer that everything happen your way, on your time. If that means you’re ten hours late, so be it.
<br>
<br>
You’re a social butterfly who loves to be surrounded by people in a beautiful setting, talking and hanging out for hours. Just remember to save some time for yourself.
<br>
<br>
Libras can get so caught up in the moment, they forget to handle their own responsibilities. Learn the beauty of being organized, and you’ll have all the time in the world to enjoy your beautiful life.

December 29, 2020: <br> With the year’s second full moon in Cancer moon shining its beams from your ambitious tenth house, you can squeeze in one more victory dance before 2020 wraps. What can you tackle today and actually finish before NYE? Popping this feather in your cap can set you up for a lucrative pitch in early 2021. If everything on your list is too major, then chip away at a piece of this project. And since this is a luminous full moon, share your Greatest Hits of 2020 on social media. You’ll get a buzz going before you know it.

<p class="p1" align="left">
From December 28 to January 3: <br>
Don't hang up your fedora just yet, Libra. There could be one final feather to place in that cap this year! Your hopes, prayers and hard work could really pay off under the glow of Tuesday's full moon in Cancer and your tenth house of success, the second one to land in this sign in 2020. A goal you've been striving toward since the first Cancer full moon (also a lunar eclipse!) on January 10 may finally be within reach. 
<br>
<br>
Step up to the plate, because you could knock it right out of the park before the ball drops on NYE—or right after, since there are two weeks of peak manifesting for this full moon. You might be tapped for a leadership position that gives you greater independence or a supporting team to help you accomplish some of the big ideas you proposed to the powers that be. Regardless of who signs your paycheck, if you have projects to finish before the end of 2020, la luna gives you plenty of hustle. Spare no midnight oil: Important eyes are watching you and your dedication will impress.
<br>
<br>
Get ready to peel some “onions” this Wednesday. People who seem bland on the surface could be hiding more than a few fascinating layers you had no clue were there. With Venus squaring esoteric Neptune, it’s going to take some of your Libra charms to draw these folks out of their shells—but if anyone can get them to open up it’s you! Look for clever ways to help them shine. For example, service-oriented people might not be great at sharing stories about their lives. But give them a project and watch them come to life. Since Venus IS the love planet, you never know, Libra. Pairing up on a purpose-driven mission might even spark a crush.
<br>
<br>
Keep the social fanfare going on Friday, January 1, because that same Leo moon marches you into 2021. If you feel so inspired, drop off care packages to a few neighbors or friends who live in close proximity. A mimosa kit or even a hot NYD brunch could be a sweet surprise as you wave to them from six feet away. Virtual vision-boarding or getting the family on a Google Hangout will keep your crew connected, which, for a Libra, is the most important way to kick off a New Year!
