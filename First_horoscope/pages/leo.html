<p class="p1" align="justify">The Sun is the center of our solar system and the ruler of Leo.
When the whole universe revolves around you, it’s hard to be humble! Like the Sun, Leo heats everything up with its dazzling drama. And when the Sun sets, it’s ice, ice baby. That’s why friends of Leo know to keep them happy and shining… or else.
<br>
<br>
Leo is the sign of drama, and oh, can you put on a show! Even the Leos who pretend to be shy come to life in the spotlight. A natural-born leader, you love to be the boss. Leos need mega-doses of praise and appreciation, which may cause people to think you’re self-centered.
<br>
<br>
The truth is, you have a huge heart, and you’re the zodiac’s most generous sign. You’re always there to help, spoil, and protect the people you love. So what if your appetite is huge? Your energy may be hard for others to match.
<br>
<br>
Remember, people express love in different ways, and not everyone can show it like you do. But it’s never boring to be part of your glamorous world, so let your star shine. Somebody’s gotta rule, and it might as well be you!

December 29, 2020: <br> Never mind whatever (and whoever) slid down the chimney and went up in smoke. With the second full moon of 2020 landing in emotional Cancer and your twelfth house of release, endings and healing, you can bid adieu to anything that no longer has a place in your life. This could be a person, relationship or limiting belief system that’s held you back or kept you stuck. As you peer ahead to 2021, let la luna illuminate a path to getting beyond this. Let go with love and gratitude, but don’t look back!.

From December 28 to January 3: <br>
Tuesday's skies have a clear message for you: Surrender! This December 29, the year's second full moon in Cancer lands in your twelfth house of transitions and healing, urging you to let go of anything that's dragging you down. If there's something—or someone—that is no longer serving you, it's time to move beyond it. You've got support from the universe to walk away from draining job responsibilities, a toxic friendship or self-limiting beliefs. Or if you don't want to bail, at least speak up and get yourself off the hamster wheel of gaslighting and manipulation.
<br>
<br>
Being nice doesn't work with everyone, so you'll need to put your fleece-lined slipper down. You don't rack up any karmic brownie points for suffering through it. And the faster you turn the tide, the sooner you'll open the hatch to opportunities that are more in sync with your highest values. Remind yourself that you're opening the door for better opportunities to flow in. This full moon could illuminate a mentor figure or a healing source of support that can ease the transition. You don't have to weather it alone!
<br>
<br>
But don't make any sudden moves, especially not this Wednesday. With romantic Venus in your demonstrative fifth house getting checked by elusive Neptune in your erotic eighth, you may struggle to interpret people’s signals. That alone is frustrating, Leo, but this sensitive mashup will cause you to take everything personally. You’re not being “rejected” because your S.O. didn’t hold your hand on the walk to the car or took three hours to return your text. Fight against the green-eyed monster, who will be ready to fill your head with insanity near Wednesday. But don’t flip to the other end of the spectrum either! A Venus-Neptune square can drop a rose-colored filter over your love goggles. Is it happily ever after or just a hygge season hookup? The jury’s out, Leo, but you’re going to have to ride this out a little longer before you have a final verdict.
<br>
<br>
It may be a very intimate NYE, but who says you can't pull out every COVID-approved stop in the book? This New Years has your name—and your sign—written all over it! On both Thursday the 31st AND Friday the 1st, the moon is glimmering in Leo, putting you in your dazzling and celebratory element. Dress "as if" you're going to be dancing on a South Beach VIP roof deck (a la Leo Jennifer Lopez) then see if you can recreate that feel in your own living room. If you feel like getting camera-ready, your followers and fans will thank you for the Reels moment. The turn of a year can dredge up some deep feels for your passionate sign, especially when the emo moon is hanging in your sign. If you're not hanging IRL, touch base with your supportive sounding boards who will happily replay the best and worst moments of 2020—and maybe even help you see the humor in it all. Second to laughter, nothing's more therapeutic than dancing so log in for a livestreamed DJ set. As the party animal of the zodiac, you can get a little carried away when the champagne starts flowing. Even if it's a short walk from your living room to bed, match each sip of bubbly with at least one gulp of good old H2O.
