<h2 align="center" style="color:purple">All About Capricorn, the Structured and Responsible Sea Goat and the Zodiac Sign of Success</h2>

<p class="p1" align="justify">Serious Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, the planet of tough lessons and wisdom. As a result, many Capricorns are “old souls” who play by the rules and follow tradition.
Accustomed to regular butt-kickings from Saturn, you often see life as an uphill battle, with the ultimate reward arriving only through suffering and sacrifice.
<br>
<br>
Ambitious Capricorn is symbolized by a mountain goat climbing up a rocky hill, taking one cautious step at a time. And that’s exactly how patient Caps like to do everything. You’ll skip the good stuff today if it means getting the reward tomorrow. That’s why your sign has more trophies and loyal friends than any other–you stay strong through the hard times.
<br>
<br>
Hardworking Caps are devoted to their friends and families, and people count on you for support. You always keep your word.
<br>
<br>
Remember to let yourself have fun, too! Life doesn’t always have to be a struggle. It’s okay to enjoy your victories, even if you didn’t work hard to win them. Lighten up and share your wacky, down-to-earth humor. When you get moody, let your family and closest friends be there for you–just as you always are for them.

<p class="p1" align="left">
December 29, 2020: <br> Today, the moon is full in Cancer, and it’s shining a bright beam on your relationships. Clear your schedule of any activities that aren’t obligatory and allow yourself to be spontaneous and romantic. This lunar lift practically insists on you having some good old-fashioned fun with your favorite peeps—and if you’re comfortable meeting outdoors, bring your mask and a special bottle to toast the end of this crazy year. Some Capricorns might get a surprise proposal—with a ring or just some serious intentions. Single? You could meet someone with keeper potential over the next two weeks.

<p class="p1" align="left">
From December 28 to January 3: <br>
The negotiating table beckons this Tuesday, December 29, so get ready to play, well…softball. As the year's second full moon in sensitive Cancer illuminates your partnership house, keeping an open heart actually gives you the upper hand. But think carefully before you peg anyone as partnership material. Although you may seem to have everything in common up front, a little digging might reveal divergent values around time, money and relationships. This doesn't have to be a deal breaker though, but some negotiating will be necessary to harmonize the attraction of opposites. 
<br>
<br>
If you're halfway engaged in a going-nowhere "thing," this is your cue to clear the decks and create space for someone who is interested in pursuing an actual relationship in the here and now. For Capricorns who are in a solid, loving union, your status could evolve in exciting ways. With intimate Cancer directing these moonbeams, planning more private, "just the two of us" time could reignite sparks. In your everyday life, consciously look for ways to co-create, like starting a healthy eating and exercise program together in early January.
<br>
<br>
Don’t be too quick to mend fences on Wednesday—not at the expense of your values. With peacekeeping Venus squaring forgiving Neptune, you want it to be “all love.” But if you rush the process, you’ll only wind up having to deal with the fallout later…and doubly so, since you’ll probably be feeling resentful that you backpedaled on how you REALLY feel the first time around. If someone tries to charm you with a bull**** apology, be gracious without losing ground. Thank them for making the effort to resolve this matter—and be clear that you’re going to need some time. Even in relationships where everything’s copacetic, keep your guard up a little near Wednesday. A friend, coworker, even your love interest, may be trying to hard-sell you on an idea that you need more time to research.
